## 📖 Overview

Welcome to `OpenTicket` project and to the Internet Computer development community. OpenTicket is a next-generation blockchain-based platform for secure, transparent, and efficient ticket purchasing, distribution, and validation. Powered by ICP Canisters and uAgents, each ticket is issued as a unique NFT with a digital signature that cannot be forged or duplicated. The system offers flexible payments (fiat or tokens with discounts), ticket resale through a marketplace with automatic royalties for organizers, and fair dynamic pricing. By leveraging blockchain transparency, OpenTicket eliminates counterfeit tickets and prevents irresponsible scalping, ensuring a fairer ecosystem for both organizers and attendees. Beyond concerts, exhibitions, and institutional events, the application can also be extended to transportation services such as flights, trains, and buses—making it a versatile super app for all ticketing needs in the Web3 era.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Real-time multi-agent communication
- ✅ Decentralized architecture using Fetch.ai
- ✅ ICP blockchain integration
- ✅ Automated task orchestration
- ✅ Secure message protocol
- ✅ Scalable agent deployment

## 🤖 Agent Details
### Agent: OpenTicket Agent for digital signature
- **Address:** `https://agentverse.ai/agents/details/agent1qvmy3fcygaq5hcecwq9tgquwmqm99e2qa9nfdqny8rzknq34vk8n5u8az4q/profile`
- **Protocol:** AgentChatProtocolv0.3.0
- **Endpoints:** `/submit`


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install uagents
pip install websockets
pip install aiohttp


To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `OpenTicket`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd OpenTicket/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
dfx generate
npm run dev
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
## 🏗️ System Architecture


### 🔹 Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with **React + TypeScript** for strong type safety and better developer experience.  
  - Uses **TailAdmin** as a credit-based template system for modern UI/UX design.  
  - Integrates directly with the **dfinity agent** to interact with ICP smart contracts.  

- **Backend (API Layer):**  
  - Developed using **Python FastAPI** for high performance, async I/O, and easy RESTful API creation.  
  - Handles user authentication, off-chain operations, payment orchestration, and integration with third-party services.  

- **Smart Contracts (On-chain):**  
  - Written in **Motoko** and deployed on the **Internet Computer (ICP)**.  
  - Responsible for ticket minting (NFT-based), ownership transfers, royalties, and validation logic.  
  - Ensures transparency and immutability for every ticket transaction.  

- **Agent Layer:**  
  - Powered by **uAgents** with support for **Fetch.ai** decentralized agent communication.  
  - Uses **Dfinity Agent** for secure messaging between frontend, backend, and ICP canisters.  
  - Manages ticket signing, validation requests, and real-time agent-to-agent communication.  

- **Infrastructure & Deployment:**  
  - Local development and testing using **DFX** and replica environments.  
  - Scalable deployment with ICP canisters.  
  - Optionally extended with multi-agent orchestration and cloud-native environments.  

### 🔹 High-Level Flow
1. **User Interaction (Frontend):**  
   User purchases a ticket via the React + TS frontend (TailAdmin UI).  

2. **Backend Processing (FastAPI):**  
   Request goes to FastAPI which validates the purchase, handles payments, and triggers ticket issuance.  

3. **On-chain Execution (ICP Motoko):**  
   FastAPI communicates with ICP canister via dfinity agent → Smart contract mints NFT ticket + signs with electronic signature.  

4. **Agent Communication:**  
   uAgents + Fetch.ai manage real-time verification and AI Assitant.  

5. **Ticket Delivery:**  
   User receives a verifiable NFT ticket in wallet/app, ready for scanning/validation at events.

📌 With this architecture, `OpenTicket` ensures:  
- Scalability across multiple event sizes  
- Security through blockchain immutability + digital signatures  
- Seamless UI/UX with React + TailAdmin  
- Flexibility for fiat & token-based payments  
- Extendability for transportation, exhibitions, and Web3 super-app use cases
